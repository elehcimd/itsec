iotrace is an userspace read()/write() logger daemon for linux,osf1,
openbsd, freebsd. worked (with satisfaction) on: su, ssh, ftp, telnet,
rsh, scp, rlogin, rexec, passwd, adduser, mysql, gpg. it works using
ptrace(2) & friends. 

This is not an exploit, you must run iotrace as root in order to trace
the processes of other users.


** If the OS you're interested in is not yet supported, write the port
** and contact me ! if you've troubles compiling it, contact me! if you 
** find bugs, contact me!


How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When su,ssh,.. is executed iotrace traces it logging the I/O 
through read(2)/write(2) (not recvfrom!) for n seconds, only
if the count of read/written bytes is less than <count> bytes. 
This restriction has some advantages: less noise. 


Supported OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Linux
- OSF1 
- OpenBSD 
- FreeBSD

Tested on:

- Debian Woody (3.0), Linux 2.4.22
- Debian Woody (3.0), Linux 2.6.3
- Red Hat Linux release 5.2 (Apollo), Linux 2.0.36
- Red Hat Linux release 7.2 (Enigma), Linux 2.4.7-10
- OSF1 v4.0
- OpenBSD 3.4
- FreeBSD 4.5-STABLE (compiles but not tested)

!! DOES NOT WORK IF SUCKIT IS RUNNING !! SUCKIT FUCKS PTRACE !!


iotrace, diet libc and upx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'make tiny-linux' produces the iotrace executable:
- statically linked against diet libc
- stripped
- compressed (if upx is found)
before packing iotrace is ~ 27k, after ~ 16k :)

WARNING: you must use a diet libc version >= 0.25
         (otherwise ptrace(2) will not work.. a little bug.)


Running iotrace on a rootkitted system 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) With Adore works well.
2) With All userspace rootkits works well. (Linux&c)
3) With SuckIT doesn't work well: the system may Oops, freezing
   iotrace and the ptraced process (not the whole system).
   (This is clearly a suckit problem)

You can't test iotrace if your telnet/ssh/.. process is hidden
because (probably) it's hidden to iotrace too!


Running iotrace on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ptrace(2) is used. Every traced process has its own tracing child.
(there's a way to avoid this?)


Running iotrace on OSF1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
all through ioctl() calls, /proc required. Only 1 tracing process.


Running iotrace on OpenBSD,FreeBSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ktrace(2) is used (noise removed when the trace ends). Only 1
tracing process.


idioteque
~~~~~~~~~
sniffs r/w data of a specified process. You can select all or
only a subset of fds. Works only on linux.


pcat
~~~~
breaks a logfile into possible passwords (useful with john!)
example:

xenion@gollum:~/cvs/locale/iotrace$ cat mylog 
passòword
xenion@gollum:~/cvs/locale/iotrace$ ./pcat mylog | sort | uniq
a
as
ass
d
o
or
ord
p
pa
pas
pass
r
rd
s
ss
xenion@gollum:~/cvs/locale/iotrace$
