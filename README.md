# **IT Security tools**: Back to the Future

I used to play with IT security as an hobby that resulted in a series of 
public tools and some articles published on the [Italian hacking E-zines](http://www.autistici.org/hacking_e-zines/) "Butchered From Inside" and "Newbies".
This repository contains part of what I've learned during those golden days.

* **hopfake**: monitor and fake network traceroute requests
* **libimbw**: library that implements a full duplex protocol to build covert channels proxed to TCP
* **mikhail** connect hosts behind NATs
* **cookie-tools**: steal web sessions from nearby Wi-Fi connected devices
* **ptrace-tools**: inject commands on ptraced telnet/ssh sessions (still working like a charm)
* **rtpbreak**: sniff and reconstruct voice calls of IP-based phones (now part of Kali Linux)
* **icopy**: datalink bridge that reads and writes packets between network interfaces
* **smokingtwojoints.c**: log ssh/telnet sessions (and sshd/telnetd childs..) using ptrace(2)
* **iotrace**: userspace read()/write() logger daemon for linux,osf1, openbsd, freebsd
* **khideee.c**: hide tasks to KSTAT

As always, at your own risk: have fun and be responsible!
