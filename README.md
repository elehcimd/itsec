### **IT Security tools**: Back to the Future

I used to play with IT security as an hobby that resulted in a series of 
public tools and some articles published on the [Italian hacking E-zines](http://www.autistici.org/hacking_e-zines/) "Butchered From Inside" and "Newbies".
This repository contains part of what I've done those days.

* the **hopfake** tool lets you monitor and fake network traceroute requests
* the **libimbw** library implements a full duplex protocol to build covert channels proxed to TCP
* the mikhail tool helps you to connect hosts behind NATs
* the **cookie-tools** utils lets you steal web sessions from nearby Wi-Fi connected devices
* with **ptrace-tools** you can inject commands on a ptraced telnet/ssh sessions (still working like a charm)
* with **rtpbreak** you can sniff voice calls of IP-based phones (now part of Kali Linux)

As always, at your own risk: have fun and be responsible!
